### Automation and Scripts

You can also use the conversation agent in automations and scripts:

service: conversation.process
data:
  agent_id: conversation.mistral_ai_mistral_small_latest
  text: "What's the weather like today?"
```

### Custom Prompts

You can customize the system prompt to make the AI assistant more helpful
for your specific use case:

**Example - Smart Home Assistant:**

```text
You are a helpful smart home assistant for {{ ha_name }}.
You help users control their smart home devices and answer questions about home automation.
Be concise and focus on actionable responses.
Current location: {{ ha_name }}
```

**Example - Family Assistant:**

```text
You are a friendly family assistant named Alex for the {{ ha_name }} household.
You help with daily tasks, reminders, and general questions.
Always be warm and family-friendly in your responses.
```

## API Usage and Costs

This integration uses the Mistral AI API, which is a paid service. Costs depend on:

- **Model used**: Larger models cost more per token
- **Usage volume**: You pay per token (input + output)
- **Token limits**: Set appropriate max_tokens to control costs

### Cost Optimization Tips

1. **Choose the right model**: Use smaller models for simpler tasks
2. **Set reasonable token limits**: Don't set max_tokens higher than needed
3. **Use concise prompts**: Shorter system prompts reduce input costs
4. **Monitor usage**: Check your Mistral AI console for usage statistics

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Integration won't load:**

- Check that you have the correct API key
- Verify your internet connection
- Check Home Assistant logs for error details

**API errors:**

- Verify your Mistral AI account has sufficient credits
- Check if you've exceeded rate limits
- Ensure your API key has the necessary permissions

**Slow responses:**

- Try a smaller/faster model like `mistral-small-latest`
- Reduce the max_tokens setting
- Check your internet connection speed
